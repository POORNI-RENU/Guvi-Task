Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. By using HTTP user sends the request to the server &
the server sends the response to the user. There are several stages of development of HTTP.

HTTP/1.1
HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997
Ithe usest works on the textual format.
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.	
It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
It compresses data by itself.

HTTP/2
The new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.
It works on the binary protocol.
It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
It uses HPACK for data compression.
